For example, let's take the following code cell using the [fenced](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html#fenced-echo) output to ensure options are passed forward.

````md
```{{r}}
#| echo: fenced
#| eval: true
1 + 1
```
````

Using the **{quarto-panelize}** extension, you can show the code cell and its output together in one tab, and separately display the source of the code cell with nearly all options (minus `echo`) in another tab tab. Here's how it can be done:

````md
:::{.to-panel}
```{{r}}
#| echo: fenced
#| eval: true
1 + 1
```
:::
````

This will create two tabs: Result and Source.

:::{.to-panel}

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
#| eval: true
1 + 1
```

:::

Without setting `echo: fenced`, the Source tab will only display the code without results.

:::{.to-panel}


```{r}
#| eval: true
1 + 1
```
